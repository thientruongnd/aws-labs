# Creating a VPC with Public and Private Subnets for Your Compute Environments

Compute resources in your compute environments need external network access to communicate with the Amazon ECS service endpoint. However, you might have jobs that you would like to run in private subnets. Creating a VPC with both public and private subnets provides you the flexibility to run jobs in either a public or private subnet. Jobs in the private subnets can access the internet through a NAT gateway.


## Step 1: Create an Elastic IP Address for Your NAT Gateway

A NAT gateway requires an Elastic IP address in your public subnet, but the VPC wizard does not create one for you. Create the Elastic IP address before running the VPC wizard.

To create an Elastic IP address

1.  Open the Amazon VPC console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>.

2.  In the left navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

3.  Choose Allocate new address, Allocate, Close.

4.  Note the Allocation ID for your newly created Elastic IP address; you enter this later in the VPC wizard.


## Step 2: Run the VPC Wizard

The VPC wizard automatically creates and configures most of your VPC resources for you.

**To run the VPC wizard**

1.  In the left navigation pane, choose **VPC Dashboard**.

2.  Choose **Launch VPC Wizard, VPC with Public and Private Subnets, Select**.

3.  For **VPC name**, give your VPC a unique name.

4.  For **Elastic IP Allocation ID**, choose the ID of the Elastic IP address that you created earlier.

5.  Choose **Create VPC**.

6.  When the wizard is finished, choose **OK**. Note the Availability Zone in which your VPC subnets were created. Your additional subnets should be created in a different Availability Zone.

    Non-default subnets, such as those created by the VPC wizard, are not auto-assigned public IPv4 addresses. Instances launched in the public subnet must be assigned a public IPv4 address to communicate with the Amazon ECS service endpoint.

**To modify your public subnet's IPv4 addressing behavior**

1.  In the left navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

2.  Select the public subnet for your VPC By default, the name created by the VPC wizard is **Public subnet**.

3.  Choose **Actions, Edit subnet settings**.

4.  Select the **Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address** check box, and then choose **Save**.

## Step 3: Create Additional Subnets

The wizard creates a VPC with a single public and a single private subnet in a single Availability Zone. For greater availability, you should create at least one more of each subnet type in a different Availability Zone so that your VPC has both public and private subnets across two Availability Zones.

**To create an additional private subnet**

1.  In the left navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

2.  Choose **Create Subnet**.

3.  For **Name tag**, enter a name for your subnet, such as **Private subnet**.

4.  For **VPC**, choose the VPC that you created earlier.

5.  For **Availability Zone**, choose a different Availability Zone than your original subnets in the VPC.

6.  For **IPv4 CIDR** block, enter a valid CIDR block. For example, the wizard creates CIDR blocks in 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 by default. You could use **10.0.3.0/24** for your second private subnet.

7.  Choose **Yes, Create**.

**To create an additional public subnet**

1.  In the left navigation pane, choose **Subnets** and then **reate Subnet**.

2.  For **Name tag**, enter a name for your subnet, such as **Public subnet**.

3.  For **VPC**, choose the VPC that you created earlier.

4.  For **Availability Zone**, choose the same Availability Zone as the additional private subnet that you created in the previous procedure.

5.  For **IPv4 CIDR block**, enter a valid CIDR block. For example, the wizard creates CIDR blocks in 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 by default. You could use **10.0.2.0/24** for your second public subnet.

6.  Choose **Yes, Create**.

7.  Select the public subnet that you just created and choose **Route Table**, **Edit**.

8.  By default, the private route table is selected. Choose the other available route table so that the **0.0.0.0/0** destination is routed to the internet gateway (**igw**-`xxxxxxxx`) and choose **Save**.

9.  With your second public subnet still selected, choose **Subnet Actions, Modify auto-assign IP settings**.

10. Select **Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address** and choose **Save, Close**.
